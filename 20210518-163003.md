## 5 things I wish I knew when I started Calisthenics (from Chris Heria)

- Basics:
  - Do a lot of repetitions
- Perfect form
- Grip strenght
- Negatives
- Consistency and goal


### Exemples:

- 50 diamond push-up:
  - And the next days you aim for 60
- Bar hang weighted
- Muscle up 
- Negative muscle ups:
  - By using pull over
